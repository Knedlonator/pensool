This is a note about experimental code in pyusecase to make usecases playback at the speed of their recording. (Currently the only choices are 1) as fast as possible or 2) slow motion.)

In general, testing using texttest and pyusecase should abstract GUI toolkit events.  Testing usually abstracts away, and is independent of, position and time of events.
However, I am trying to test new GUI techniques in custom widgets, where time and position of the GUI events is important.  (I am not testing gestures, but they are an example of GUI techniques that depend on the timing of their events, namely, mouse motion.)

So I made the following change to replayer.py:

TODO

There are other changes, but that is the gist of it.  I also added the isTimed() method to pyusecase Event classes, returning None (False) for most events and returning a time for my custom widget events having a time, pointer motion events.

This seems to work in that the playback speed is nearly the speed of the original recording, and the results are more nearly the same.

As always, thanks.  The pyusecase code seems rather well written and understandable.
