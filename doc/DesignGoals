Design goals:

  Uncluttered GUI
    no menubars,  scrollbars, toolbars
  Modeless GUI
    no persistent tools, no selections (except in text)
  Direct manipulation
    drag and drop fundamental
  
  Portable: don't use any modules that aren't distributed with Python
  
  Accessibility:  no 
  Command line interface (CLI): no
  Flexible GUI: user preferences for GUI: bubble, pie, conventional menus
  Themeable: only to the extent that GTK supports
  
Programming Goals

  Idiomatic: use patterns, Python idioms, recipes etc.  
  Reuse NIH (not invented here)
  High level: Python. C only where necessary for performance.
  
  Documented: 
    by pattern: say what patterns are being used.
    by meaningful names
    
  Tested: 
    doctests for base modules
    functional testing for gui
