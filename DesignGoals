Design goals:

  Uncluttered GUI
    no menubars
  Modeless GUI
  Direct manipulation
    drag and drop fundamental
  
  Portable: don't use any modules that aren't distributed with Python
  
  Accessibility:  no 
  Command line interface (CLI): no
  Flexible GUI: 
  Themeable: only to the extent that GTK supports
  
  Idiomatic: use patterns, Python idioms, etc.  almost everything is NIH (not invented here)
  High level: Python, C only where necessary for performance
  
  Innovation only in Handle Menus
  Documented: by pattern: say what patterns are being used.
